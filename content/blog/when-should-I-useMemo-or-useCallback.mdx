# When should I useMemo and useCallback?

There are specific reasons both of these hooks are built-into React:

1. Referential equality
2. Computationally expensive calculations

## Referential equality

If you're new to JavaScript/programming, it wont take long before you learn why this is the case:

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
true === true // true
false === false // true
1 === 1 // true
'a' === 'a' // true

{} === {} // false
[] === [] // false
(() => {}) === (() => {}) // false

const z = {}
z === z // true

// NOTE: React actually uses Object.is, but it's very similar to ===
```

I'm not going to go too deep into this, but suffice it to say when you define an object inside your React function component, it is not going to be referentially equal to the last time that same object was defined (even if it has all the same properties with all the same values).

There are two situations where referential equality matters in React, let's go through them one at a time.

## Dependencies List

Let's review an example.

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
function Foo({ bar, baz }) {
    const options = { bar, baz };
    React.useEffect(() => {
        buzz(options);
    }, [options]); // we want this to re-run if bar or baz change
    return <div>foobar</div>;
}

function Blub() {
    return <Foo bar="bar value" baz={3} />;
}
```

The reason this is problematic is because useEffect is going to do a referential equality check on options between every render, and thanks to the way JavaScript works, options will be new every time so when React tests whether options changed between renders it'll always evaluate to true, meaning the useEffect callback will be called after every render rather than only when bar and baz change.

There are two things we can do to fix this:

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
// option 1
function Foo({ bar, baz }) {
    React.useEffect(() => {
        const options = { bar, baz };
        buzz(options);
    }, [bar, baz]); // we want this to re-run if bar or baz change
    return <div>foobar</div>;
}
```

That's a great option and if this were a real thing that's how I'd fix this.

But there's one situation when this isn't a practical solution: If bar or baz are (non-primitive) objects/arrays/functions/etc:

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
function Blub() {
    const bar = () => {};
    const baz = [1, 2, 3];
    return <Foo bar={bar} baz={baz} />;
}
```

This is precisely the reason why useCallback and useMemo exist. So here's how you'd fix that (all together now):

```jsx {3,5} showLineNumbers
function Foo({ bar, baz }) {
    React.useEffect(() => {
        const options = { bar, baz };
        buzz(options);
    }, [bar, baz]);
    return <div>foobar</div>;
}

function Blub() {
    const bar = React.useCallback(() => {}, []);
    const baz = React.useMemo(() => [1, 2, 3], []);
    return <Foo bar={bar} baz={baz} />;
}
```

Note that this same thing applies for the dependencies array passed to useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useCallback, and useMemo.
